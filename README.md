# Shtanga problem

Imagine you had: 
- a gym rod (12lbs)
- a set of plates: [4.5, 4.5, 8.5, 8.5, 11, 11, 11, 11, 13, 13] lbs

The rod should be always balanced.

A pretty practical problem:
- List all the possible final weights of the rod with the plates
- List the solutions as well (sets of plates on the left and the right to get the weight)

A task with a star:
- If we were to buy 2 additional plates, what weights would be the most efficient ones (will enable the most additional rod configurations)

*P.S. ignore the physics, let it be a pure math problem.*

### Examples of the balanced rodes
12.0:   [] <===> []  
43.0:   [4.5, 11] <===> [4.5, 11]  
86.0:   [11, 13, 13] <===> [4.5, 4.5, 8.5, 8.5, 11]
